This package is based on turtlesim package in ROS.
To use this package you must be have turtlesim package first

The parameter about turtle's velocity:
  MAX_VELOCITY: ~100 km/s
  MIN_VELOCITY: 3.6 km/s
I want to turtle run as car with velocity from 3,6 to 100 km/s.
I use Nearest neighbour for this code.
